Integrating SMS data to capture payment information and then categorizing it with the help of machine learning.
1. SMS Integration:

    Android: Using the SmsManager API to monitor incoming SMS messages and filter out ones that contain payment information.
    iOS: SMS integration might be more challenging due to restrictions, but can use an app extension to request access to messages.

2. Parsing the SMS:

    Use regular expressions (regex) to extract relevant information from the SMS, such as the amount, vendor name, and transaction type.

3. Machine Learning Model:

    Training Data: Start by gathering training data, including SMS content, transaction amounts, and manually labeled categories.
    Model: can use models like Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, or even a simple logistic regression model to classify the expense categories based on the SMS content.
    Implementation: Implement the model in your app to suggest categories when a new transaction is detected.

4. Pop-up UI for Categorization:

    Once the SMS is parsed, show a pop-up in the app with the extracted amount and suggested category.
    Allow users to either confirm the suggestion or select a different category from a list.

5. Expense Summary:

    Store the categorized expenses in app's database.
    At the end of the month, generate a summary that includes total expenses per category, trends, and insights.
